# ⚖️ AETHER_VERITAS

### **Enterprise Logic Governance & Autonomous Reconciliation Fabric**

**AETHER_VERITAS** is a high-prowess architectural framework engineered to solve the "Inheritance Paradox" in unstructured insurance manuscripts. It replaces fragile, prompt-based AI with a **Deterministic Governance Gate**, ensuring that every model output is a direct derivative of certified regional overrides and global master logic.

## 🏛️ The Architectural Thesis: The "Inheritance Paradox"

In multi-national insurance deployments, the "Truth" is rarely found in a single file. It exists in the delta between **Regional Overlays** (`ca_overlay.xml`) and **Global Base Layers** (`global_base.xml`). 

**AETHER_VERITAS** treats these manuscripts as a **Distributed Logic Graph**. By implementing a **Self-Healing State Machine**, the system dynamically reconstructs missing regional logic by traversing the Global Inheritance path. This ensures that the LLM is never "hallucinating" a rule; it is simply navigating a pre-validated architectural hierarchy [cite: 2026-01-08].

## ⚛️ System Topology: The Multi-Agent DAG

The following **Mermaid** specification defines the stateful transition from raw XML ingestion to autonomous remediation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph KNOWLEDGE_FABRIC ["KNOWLEDGE_FABRIC (Layer 1)"]
        A1[Regional Overlay XML] --> B{Aether_Indexer}
        A2[Global Master XML] --> B
        B --> C[Normalized Logic Map: metadata.json]
        B --> D[Semantic Vector Space: vectors.npy]
    end

    subgraph GOVERNANCE_ENGINE ["GOVERNANCE_ENGINE (Layer 2)"]
        E[Inquiry] --> F[Agentic Router: LangGraph]
        F --> G{Logic Synthesis}
        G -- "Logic Gap Detected" --> H[Autonomous Inheritance Loop]
        G -- "Validated Node" --> I[Veritas Certification]
        H --> I
    end

    subgraph REMEDIATION_FABRIC ["REMEDIATION_FABRIC (Layer 3)"]
        I --> J[Veritas Output]
        J --> K{Remediation Logic}
        K -- "Anomaly: Create" --> L[Jira: Initialization]
        K -- "Resolved: Self-Heal" --> M[Jira: Auto-Closure]
        K -- "Critical: Escalate" --> N[Human-in-the-Loop]
    end

## 🛡️ The Autonomous Remediation Layer

Unlike standard "loggers," this system implements an **Active Remediation Protocol**. The architecture is designed to manage its own lifecycle of integrity [cite: 2026-01-08]:

* **Stateful Ticket Initialization**: The system creates Jira tickets immediately upon identifying a logic discrepancy or manuscript conflict that cannot be resolved via inheritance [cite: 2026-01-08].
* **Self-Healing Calibration**: The engine attempts to autonomously "patch" the data state by resolving the ticket through global master reconciliation [cite: 2026-01-08].
* **Deterministic Escalation**: If the self-healing loop cannot reach a 100% confidence threshold, the ticket is automatically escalated to a Senior Architect, preventing any "Logic Leakage" into production [cite: 2026-01-08].
